# onup-customer-segmentation
For my Marketing Analytics project at Northeastern University, I worked with OnUp Protein Water, which is a startup near my hometown in Minnesota. OnUp Protein Water is a flavored water packed full of protein and electrolytes, thus being a great option for post-workout with a refreshing taste. For this project, OnUp wanted to learn more about who their customers are, so we decided to conduct a K-means cluster analysis with four clusters. We then used these clusters to create a segmentation analysis on our four "customers"--Angela, Jessica, Jonathan, and Sophia. Please refer to the OnUp Graphic file for descriptions of our four segments based on the analysis.
